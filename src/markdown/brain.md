# About

Brian's Brain is a cellular automaton devised by Brian Silverman, which is very similar to his Seeds rule. It consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, but unlike Seeds, each cell may be in one of three states: on, dying, or off. Each cell is considered to have eight neighbors (Moore neighborhood), as in Seeds and Conway's Game of Life.

# States

* dead (black)
* live (white)
* dying (blue)

# Rules

* Any dead cell with exactly 2 neighbors becomes a live cell
* Any live cell becomes a dying cell
* All other cells die
