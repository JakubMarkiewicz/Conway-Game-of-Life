# About

Seeds is a cellular automaton in the same family as the Game of Life, initially investigated by Brian Silverman and named by Mirek WÃ³jtowicz. It consists of infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which may be in one of two states: on or off. Each cell is considered to have eight neighbors (Moore neighborhood), as in Life.

# States

* dead (black)
* live (white)

# Rules

* Any dead cell with exactly 2 neighbors becomes a live cell
* All other cells die
